All components are designed mobile-first and progressively enhanced for larger screens.

### 4. **Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast ratios
- Focus management

### 5. **Performance**
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Optimized loading states
- Efficient component rendering
- Minimal bundle size impact

## Usage Examples

### Implementing Department-Specific Features

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  // Show department-specific content
  if (user?.role === 'Sales') {
    return <SalesSpecificContent />;
  }

  return <DefaultContent />;
};
```

### Using the Theme System

```tsx
import { useThemeContext } from '../contexts/ThemeContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { darkMode, toggleDarkMode, departmentTheme } = useThemeContext();
  const theme = departmentTheme(user?.role || 'Admin');

  return (
    <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main }}>
      Content with department colors
    </Box>
  );
};
```

### Loading States

```tsx
import LoadingSkeleton from '../components/LoadingSkeleton';

const DataTable = ({ loading, data }) => {
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSkeleton variant="table" rows={5} />;
  }

  return <DataGrid data={data} />;
};
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Department Colors

1. Update `departmentColors` in `ThemeContext.tsx`
2. Add role-specific navigation in `Layout.tsx`
3. Update `navigationConfig` object

### Creating New Navigation Items

```tsx
// In navigationConfig
{
  title: 'New Section',
  items: [
    {
      text: 'New Page',
      icon: <NewIcon />,
      path: '/new-page',
      badge: 5 // Optional notification count
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Loading Skeletons

```tsx
// Add new variant to LoadingSkeleton.tsx
const renderCustomSkeleton = () => (
  <Stack spacing={2}>
    {/* Your custom skeleton structure */}
  </Stack>
);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Consistent Spacing**
Use Material-UI's spacing system (theme.spacing()) for all margins and padding.

### 2. **Color Usage**
- Use department colors for primary actions and highlights
- Maintain sufficient contrast ratios
- Use semantic colors (error, warning, success) appropriately

### 3. **Typography Hierarchy**
Follow the established typography scale:
- H1-H6 for headings
- Body1/Body2 for content
- Caption for metadata

### 4. **Animation Guidelines**
- Use theme transitions for consistency
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Keep animations purposeful and quick (200-300ms)

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- Test on multiple device sizes
- Use breakpoint helpers from Material-UI
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px
