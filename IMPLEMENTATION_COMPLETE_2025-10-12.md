# Per-User SMTP Implementation Complete - October 12, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete per-user SMTP email system for BMAsia CRM. Each user can now send emails from their own Gmail account with proper authentication and reply-to handling.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Django)

#### 1. **User Model Updates** (`crm_app/models.py`)
- Added `smtp_email` field (EmailField) for user's Gmail address
- Added `smtp_password` field (CharField) for Gmail app password
- Created `get_smtp_config()` method that returns SMTP configuration dictionary
- Returns None if user has no SMTP configured (falls back to system default)

#### 2. **Database Migration** (`crm_app/migrations/0025_user_smtp_email_user_smtp_password.py`)
- Created and ran migration locally
- Migration will run automatically on Render deployment
- Adds two new nullable fields to auth_user table

#### 3. **Email Service Updates** (`crm_app/services/email_service.py`)
Updated four email sending methods with per-user SMTP support:
- `send_quote_email()` - accepts `request` parameter, uses user's SMTP
- `send_contract_email()` - accepts `request` parameter, uses user's SMTP
- `send_invoice_email()` - accepts `request` parameter, uses user's SMTP
- `send_manual_renewal_reminder()` - accepts `request` parameter, uses user's SMTP

**Per-User SMTP Logic:**
```python
if request and request.user.is_authenticated:
    user_smtp = request.user.get_smtp_config()
    if user_smtp:
        smtp_connection = get_connection(
            host='smtp.gmail.com',
            port=587,
            username=user_smtp['email'],
            password=user_smtp['password'],
            use_tls=True
        )
        from_email = user_smtp['email']
        sender_name = request.user.get_full_name() or request.user.username
```

**Fallback Logic:**
- If user has no SMTP configured → uses EMAIL_SENDERS config
- If SMTP connection fails → uses EMAIL_SENDERS config
- If no authenticated user → uses EMAIL_SENDERS config

#### 4. **Settings Configuration** (`bmasia_crm/settings.py`)
- Added EMAIL_SENDERS dictionary with 5 sender profiles:
  - admin: norbert@bmasiamusic.com
  - finance: pom@bmasiamusic.com
  - sales: nikki.h@bmasiamusic.com (FIXED TYPO: was niki.h@)
  - support: keith@bmasiamusic.com
  - production: production@bmasiamusic.com
- Added SITE_URL configuration for email links

#### 5. **Admin Interface** (`crm_app/admin.py`)
- Added "Email SMTP Configuration" fieldset to UserAdmin
- Includes smtp_email and smtp_password fields
- Password field uses PasswordInput widget with asterisks
- Helpful description with link to Gmail app password setup
- Clean, professional admin UI

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

#### 1. **EmailSendDialog Component** (`bmasia-crm-frontend/src/components/EmailSendDialog.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Material-UI Dialog with responsive design
- Multi-select recipient checkboxes
- Auto-selects Primary and Billing contacts
- Editable subject field with smart defaults
- Editable multi-line body field with templates
- NO sender dropdown (automatic based on logged-in user)
- Loading states with CircularProgress
- Success/error handling with Snackbar and Alert
- BMAsia orange branding (#FFA500)
- Document details display

**Default Templates:**
- Quote: "Quote {number} from BMAsia Music"
- Contract: "Contract {number} from BMAsia Music"
- Invoice: "Invoice {number} from BMAsia Music"

#### 2. **API Service Updates** (`bmasia-crm-frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
Added three new methods:
```typescript
sendContractEmail(contractId: string, data: EmailSendData): Promise<void>
sendQuoteEmail(quoteId: string, data: EmailSendData): Promise<void>
sendInvoiceEmail(invoiceId: string, data: EmailSendData): Promise<void>
```

#### 3. **Contracts Page Integration** (`bmasia-crm-frontend/src/pages/Contracts.tsx`)
- Added "Send Email" menu item with Email icon
- Loads full contract with company contacts
- Opens EmailSendDialog with contract data
- Calls api.sendContractEmail() on submit
- Shows success notification (4 second auto-dismiss)
- Refreshes contract list on success
- Renamed "Export" to "Download PDF"

#### 4. **Quotes Page Integration** (`bmasia-crm-frontend/src/pages/Quotes.tsx`)
- Updated existing "Send Quote" menu item
- Opens EmailSendDialog instead of just marking as sent
- Loads quote with company contacts
- Calls api.sendQuoteEmail() on submit
- Shows success notification
- Refreshes quote list on success

## How It Works

### For Users

1. **Admin configures SMTP credentials** (one-time setup):
   - Go to Django admin → Users → Edit user
   - Scroll to "Email SMTP Configuration"
   - Enter Gmail address: `pom@bmasiamusic.com`
   - Enter Gmail app password: (16-character password from Google)
   - Save

2. **User sends emails:**
   - Login to CRM with their credentials
   - Navigate to Contracts or Quotes
   - Click action menu (⋮) → "Send Email"
   - Select recipients (auto-selects primary/billing contacts)
   - Edit subject/body if needed
   - Click "Send Email"
   - Email sent from their own Gmail account!

3. **Client receives and replies:**
   - Email appears from: pom@bmasiamusic.com
   - Client clicks "Reply"
   - Reply goes directly to Pom's inbox
   - Pom sees sent email in her Gmail Sent folder

### Technical Flow

```
User clicks "Send Email"
↓
Frontend: EmailSendDialog opens
↓
User selects recipients and edits content
↓
User clicks "Send"
↓
Frontend: POST /api/v1/contracts/{id}/send/
↓
Backend: email_service.send_contract_email(request=request)
↓
Backend: Check request.user.get_smtp_config()
↓
If configured: Create custom SMTP connection
If not configured: Use EMAIL_SENDERS default
↓
Backend: Send email with PDF attachment
↓
Backend: Log email in EmailLog table
↓
Frontend: Show success notification
↓
Frontend: Refresh list
```

### 3. Configure User SMTP Credentials

**For each team member, obtain Gmail app password:**

**Step 1: User creates Gmail app password**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Select device (e.g., "BMAsia CRM")
4. Click "Generate"
5. Copy the 16-character password (e.g., "abcd efgh ijkl mnop")

**Step 2: Admin adds credentials to CRM**
1. Login to Django admin: https://bmasia-crm.onrender.com/admin/
2. Navigate to Users
3. Click on user (e.g., Pom)
4. Scroll to "Email SMTP Configuration" section
5. Enter:
   - SMTP Email: `pom@bmasiamusic.com`
   - SMTP Password: `abcdefghijklmnop` (16-char password, no spaces)
6. Click "Save"

**Team Members to Configure:**
- ⚠️ Norbert: norbert@bmasiamusic.com (admin) - NO SMTP configured, uses fallback
  - Admin user currently has no smtp_email/smtp_password set
  - Falls back to EMAIL_SENDERS['admin'] → norbert@bmasiamusic.com
  - Can be configured later if needed
- ⏳ Pom: pom@bmasiamusic.com (finance) - Awaiting app password
- ⏳ Nikki: nikki.h@bmasiamusic.com (sales) - Awaiting app password (typo fixed!)
- ⏳ Keith: keith@bmasiamusic.com (support) - Awaiting app password

### 4. Test Email Sending

**Test with each configured user:**

1. **Login as Pom**
   - URL: https://bmasia-crm-frontend.onrender.com
   - Credentials: pom@bmasiamusic.com / [her password]

2. **Send Test Email**
   - Go to Contracts or Quotes
   - Click action menu (⋮) → "Send Email"
   - Select test recipient (internal email)
   - Verify pre-filled template is correct
   - Click "Send Email"

3. **Verify Email Received**
   - Check recipient inbox
   - Verify "From" address is pom@bmasiamusic.com
   - Verify PDF attachment is present
   - Click "Reply" and verify reply goes to Pom's inbox

4. **Check Pom's Gmail Sent Folder**
   - Email should appear in her Gmail Sent folder
   - Confirms email was sent through her account

5. **Repeat for other users**

### 5. Fallback Testing

**Test system fallback (user without SMTP):**
1. Create test user without SMTP credentials
2. Login as that user
3. Send email
4. Verify email sent from norbert@bmasiamusic.com (system default)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed" error

**Cause**: Incorrect Gmail app password or 2FA not enabled

**Solution**:
1. Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on Google account
2. Generate new app password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Copy password without spaces
4. Update in Django admin
5. Try sending again

### Issue: Email sent but appears in spam

**Cause**: SPF/DKIM records, Gmail trust

**Solution**:
- Emails sent through user's own Gmail should not go to spam
- If persistent, check Gmail "Less secure app access" settings
- Consider warming up email sending (send to known addresses first)

### Issue: "No recipients found" error

**Cause**: Company has no active contacts with email addresses

**Solution**:
1. Go to company detail page
2. Add contacts with email addresses
3. Mark contacts as "Active"
4. Try sending again

### Issue: Migration failed on production

**Cause**: Migration didn't run automatically

**Solution**:
```bash
# SSH into Render service or run via Render shell
python manage.py migrate
```
